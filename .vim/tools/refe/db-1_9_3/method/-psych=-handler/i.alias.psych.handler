--- alias(anchor)
@todo

Called when an alias is found to +anchor+.  +anchor+ will be the name
of the anchor found.

=== Example

Here we have an example of an array that references itself in YAML:

  --- &ponies
  - first element
  - *ponies

&ponies is the achor, *ponies is the alias.  In this case, alias is
called with "ponies".
