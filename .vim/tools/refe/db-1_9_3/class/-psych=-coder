If an object defines +encode_with+, then an instance of Psych::Coder will
be passed to the method when the object is being serialized.  The Coder
automatically assumes a Psych::Nodes::Mapping is being emitted.  Other
objects like Sequence and Scalar may be emitted if +seq=+ or +scalar=+ are
called, respectively.
